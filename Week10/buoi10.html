    <p class="content">The house is in a quiet area. It is not in the city centre. It is in city foreign. There are four rooms in my house. There is a living room, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. The living room is not very big, but it is comfortable. We watch TV and talk together there. My bedroom is small, but I like it. There is a bed, a desk and a wardrobe in my room. I study and relax there every day. The kitchen is next to the living room. My mother cooks meals there, and we eat together in the evening. This house is my dream house. But I want my house have a garden. I love it. </p>
